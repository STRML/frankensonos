"""A stand-in daemon for the E2E harness (rows 20 to 25).

    stub-daemon.py PORT

* GET /events is refused with the POLICY_DENIED body the real daemon sent a LAN caller before `events` was added to
  its allow list (row 20: the app must stay connected and say why).
* Two rooms behave like speakers, so the app can be tested against the timing of real hardware (row 22):
  - "Lag Room" answers a resume the way a Sonos does, measured on a real one: the first read after the command still
    says `paused`, the next says `transitioning`, then `playing`. A pause takes effect at once.
  - "Stuck Room" accepts a resume and never starts playing, so the app must not claim it plays forever.
* The Spotify routes answer with the exact shapes of fsonos-api's spotify.rs (rows 23 to 25): status, a sync that
  runs for two reads, two albums, their tracks and liked tracks. POST /play and /dj/* are recorded and GET
  /_debug/posts returns what was posted, so a test can check what the app sent.
