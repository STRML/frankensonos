//! The one error model every surface reports.
//!
//! A [`Failure`] is a stable [`ErrorCode`] plus an agent-readable `detail`, a
//! one-sentence `hint` on what to do next, and `suggestions` to retry with
//! (for example the nearest room names). The code fixes the HTTP status, the
//! CLI exit code, and whether retrying unchanged can succeed, so the same
//! failure reads the same everywhere:
//!
//! * HTTP: [`Failure::http_response`], the status plus an [`ApiError`] body
//!   (`{"detail", "code", "hint", "suggestions", "retryable"}`);
//! * MCP: [`Failure::tool_text`] as the tool-error text, with the same JSON as
//!   structured content;
//! * CLI: [`Failure::cli_text`] on stderr and [`Failure::exit_code`].
//!
//! `docs/ERRORS.md` documents every code; a test keeps the two in step.
