//! The speakers a surface acts on, shared by the HTTP API and the MCP tools.
//!
//! A [`Surface`] holds the LAN transport, how to find the households (a
//! survey, cached for a short while), the house policy, and the clock. Each
//! call names its [`Client`], so one surface serves callers with different
//! identities (local agents, tailnet principals, unknown peers).
//!
//! With an action log ([`Surface::with_action_log`]), [`Surface::control`] is
//! the single choke point every mutating call goes through: authorize, plan,
//! snapshot the zones it touches, carry it out under the policy, and log who
//! asked, the policy's decision (allow / clamp / deny) and what happened.
//! [`Surface::undo`] puts the newest undoable action back.
//!
//! With the daemon's live model ([`Surface::with_live`]) the households and
//! the zones' playback come from GENA events instead of surveys and polls;
//! for a moment after a regroup, reads survey directly so a caller sees its
//! own change before the events arrive.
